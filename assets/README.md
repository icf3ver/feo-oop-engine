# Assets
Assets used in examples will not for the most part be in assets with the exception of certain objects

# Formats

## OBJ format
o = object  
g = group (better than object)  
v = vertex  
f = face  

## MTL format
There is no great place to get the standard format online

d = Dissolve (aka Opacity/Transparency)(some may read 'Tr' instead - D|S reads both)  
Ns = Shininess (aka Glossiness - Focus of Specular Highlight)  
Ni = Optical Density (aka Index of Refraction)  
Ka = Ambient Color  
Kd = Diffuse Color  
Ke = Emissive Color  
Ks = Specular Color  
Km | bump = Bump Strength  

map_Ka = Ambient Color Map Path  
map_Kd = Diffuse Color Map Path  
map_Ks = Specular color Map Path  
map_Ke = Emissive color Map Path  
map_D | map_d = Dissolve Map Path  
map_Bump | map_bump | map_Km = Bump Map Path  
map_refl | refl = Environment Map Path
